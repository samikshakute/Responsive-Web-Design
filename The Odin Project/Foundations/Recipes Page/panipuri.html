     <p>Panipuri, phuchka, gupchup, golgappa, or pani ke patashe is a type of snack originating in the Indian
          subcontinent, where it is an extremely common street food.</p>
     <p>Panipuri consists of a round hollow puri (a deep-fried crisp flatbread), filled with a mixture of flavored water
          (known as imli pani), tamarind chutney, chili powder, chaat masala, potato mash, onion, or chickpea. Fuchka
          (or fuska or puska) differs from panipuri in content and taste</p>
     <p>It uses spiced mashed potatoes as the filling. It is tangy rather than sweetish while the water is sour and
          spicy.</p>

          <li>Rinse coriander and mint leaves in water and take all the ingredients of pani.</li>
          <li>Add mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilli, ginger and lemon juice (lemon juice is added while
               grinding to prevent the mint leaves from turning dark) in the small chutney jar of a grinder.</li>
          <li>Add mint leaves, coriander leaves, green chilli, ginger and lemon juice (lemon juice is added while
               grinding to prevent the mint leaves from turning dark) in the small chutney jar of a grinder.</li>
          <li>Transfer them to a large bowl and add sugar, chaat masala powder, black salt and 4 cups water. Stir with a
               large spoon and mix it properly. Taste for the salt and add as required. Pani is ready; place it in a
               refrigerator for at least 1-hour before serving or use it at room temperature. If you like soft boondi,
               mix it now. If you like crispy taste of boondi then mix it at the time of serving.</li>
          <li>Take mashed potato, kala chana, red chilli powder, cumin-coriander powder, chaat masala powder, coriander
               leaves and salt (add only if you have not added while boiling the potatoes and chana) in a bowl.</li>
          <li>Mix them together with a spoon. Masala is ready.
          </li>
          <li>Take each puri and gently make a large hole on its top-middle side with a spoon or your index finger or
               thumb for stuffing.
          </li>
          <li>Stuff it with masala (more or less, as you like). Sprinkle onion and sev over it and drizzle a drop of
               date tamarind chutney over it. Take pani-puri water in a medium bowl. Dip each puri in water and enjoy…
